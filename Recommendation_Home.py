    **Product recommendations** can help in:
    - Personalized Recommendations
    - Engaging the customers
    - Boosting sales and revenue
    - Delivering the most relevant content
    - Maintaining the brand experience
    
    Broadly speaking there are two kinds of recommendation approaches:
    1. **Content-based recommendations** - recommending based on the content(metadata) about the products/items, for e.g. product title, description, images, category/subcategory, specification, etc. 
    2. **Collaborative Filtering** - Focuses more on users past behaviour/preference. It filters out the products that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users.
        - Collaborative Filteting can be further broadly classified into two categories.
          - **Similarity based methods** â€“ User-user, Item-item similarity based on approaches like Nearest neighbors, kNN etc.
          - **Matrix Factorization** - SVD(Singular Value Decomposition), NMF(Non- negative Matrix Factorization), ALS(Alternating Least Square)
